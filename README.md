Help server: https://discord.gg/0nlCIL7OscrMgMiI

### What is this?
A bot-in-development that will basically be your little helper. It basically gives support for a whole heap of awesome stuff. Examples:

> `BotName tag` will bring up the tags command. The tags command can be used to store text or image URLs
>
> `BotName find` will allow you to search the channel for the given message.

There's a lot more commands, and you can find them all on the [wiki](https://github.com/deansheather/Discord-Utility-Bot/wiki/Commands-List "Commands List").
